# Habit Tracker

For years, I've struggled to maintain the habit of running. I start for a while, but eventually my entusiasm wears off and the habit dies.

**This habit tracker helps you sustain the habits that want to die.**

Currently, the app...

- Helps you articulate your goals and anti-goals
- Reminds you to achieve your goal each day
- Helps you avoid downward spirals

In the future, it will also...

- Enforce public accountability

## Two kinds of goals

There are two kinds of goals. The habit tracker only helps with the first:

[x] Goals to _do_ something (ex. go for a run)
[ ] Goals to _NOT do_ something (ex. eat sugary foods)

# Installation

The habit tracker is currently a work-in-progress. When it's ready for public use, it will be published on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore). Until then, it can be installed in its alpha state by following these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open [`chrome://extensions/`](chrome://extensions/)
3. Turn on "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select this repository folder (from step 1)

Now when you open a new tab you'll see the extension running. :)
